Hi, I’m Josh Johnson!
I'm a WSU graduate with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I'm interested in 
Hardware/Firmware development that has DSP applications. I have good experience in FPGA design from my senior year
project where I worked with a team to create a proof of concept FFT system on a Xilinx FPGA.
Our team's design will be used later to create an ASIC used on a waterflow measurement device.

Now I'm focused on improving my skills with C/C++, Python, and developing more FPGA projects. 
Looking forward to sharing the things I make here!
